    <h1>Types of servers</h1>
    <h2>1. Web server</h2>
<p>An open-source web server is used for accessing the world wide web through<br>
 public domain software. These servers connect stored information from an<br>
 internet website to your own computer. Web servers store information for the<br>
 internet that is retrieved via "HTTP" code and sent to your web browser. This is</p>

    <h2>2. Proxy server</h2>
<p>Proxy servers act as a bridge between a host server and a client server. A proxy<br>
 sends data from a website to your computer IP address after it passes through<br>
 the proxy's server. This practice adds a layer of security since the information<br>
 is requested then transferred from the source to the proxy server and never<br>
 directly from a client to another user. A proxy server can filter out various<br>
 harmful internet entities.</p>

    <h2>3. Virtual machine (VM)</h2>
<p>As their name suggests, virtual machines store and connect data strictly<br>
 through virtual space. To create a virtual machine, IT teams use a hypervisor,<br>
 also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), which is software that can<br>
 run thousands of virtual machines through only one piece of physical<br>
 hardware. This method of server virtualization is widely used for data transfer<br>
 and storage because they are the most cost-effective type of server to run.</p>

    <h2>4. File transfer protocol (FTP) server</h2>
<p>FTP servers are used to relocate files from one computer to another. Uploaded<br>
 files move from your computer to the server while downloaded files are<br>
 extracted from the server onto your device. File transfer protocol also refers to<br>
 the method of using a server to connect one computer to another in order to<br>
 share data safely.</p>

    <h2>5. Application server</h2>
<p>These servers connect clients to software applications through virtual server<br>
 connections. This allows users to bypass downloading data to their own<br>
 hardware in order to access applications. Application servers can effectively<br>
 host large amounts of application data to many users at once, making them<br>
 ideal for businesses.</p>

    <h2>6. File server</h2>
<p>A file server stores data files for multiple users. They allow for faster data<br>
 retrieval and saving or writing files to a computer. This is a basic type of server<br>
 used commonly by organizations where lots of users need access to files that<br>
 are more conveniently and safely stored on a server than a personal computer.</p>

    <h2>7. Database server</h2>
<p>Database servers function as large storage spaces that organizations use and<br>
 access to run multiple programs to meet their needs. A database server can<br>
 run independently of any database architecture.</p>
