#1 function used to display text in python is:
print('function print')
#2 in python integer is the data type that stores whole number
my_int = 20 #whole number
#3 in python text is stored in string data type
my_str = 'string'
#4
print(10 + 5 * 2) #20
#5
value = 42
#6 in python process of identifying and fixing errors in program is called debugging
#7 in python commonly used case is snake case
my_case = 'snake_case'
#8 commenting in python helps you and your team to read code correctly
#9
input('taking your input: ')
#11
print(type(my_int))
#12 there are lots of ways to convert integer into string but the easiest one is
print(type(str(my_int)))
'''
#13 term of converting one data type to another is called converting 
#14 == operator checks if the two values are equal
#15 in True and False the operation will end up false but only if its True and True it will endup true otherwise false
#16 (5 > 3) and (10 < 20) both are true so the operation will end up true
'''
if (5 > 3) and (10 < 20):
    print('True')

17 if statment is used to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on conditions
18 while loop is used to iterate over a sequence
19 for loop is used to repeat blocks as long as condition is true
20 range() function returns a sequence of numbers
21 if itself starts if statment
22 if if or else statment doesnt work else statment executes
23 in python list data is used to store collection of items
24 in python first element in list is on 0 index
25 to access 3rd element stands on 2nd index
26 slicing allows to slice chosen text
'''
27
my_list = [0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9]
print(my_list[2:6])
'''
28 steps in slicing tells the machine how much to step
29 reusable code block is called def/function
30 in python values that are passed to function are called parameters
31
'''
print(my_str.upper())
#32
my_list.append(10)
print(my_list)
#33 def defines new function
#34 return is keyword that returns a value from function
