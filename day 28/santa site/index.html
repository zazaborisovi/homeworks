        <h2>santa claus</h2>
        <h4>Santa Claus, legendary figure who is the traditional patron of Christmas in the United States and other countries,<br>
        bringing gifts to children. His popular image is based on traditions associated with Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century Christian<br>
        saint. Father Christmas fills the role in many European countries.</h4>
        <h4>The Dutch are credited with transporting the legend of Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas) to New Amsterdam (now New York City), along<br>
        with the custom of giving gifts and sweets to children on his feast day, December 6. The current depiction of Santa Claus is based<br>
        on images drawn by cartoonist Thomas Nast for Harper’s Weekly beginning in 1863. Nast’s Santa owed much to the description given in the<br>
        poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (also known as “’Twas the Night Before Christmas”), first published in 1823. The image was further defined<br>
        by the popular Santa Claus advertisements created for the Coca-Cola Company from 1931 by illustrator Haddon Sundblum. Sundblum’s Santa was<br>
        a portly white-bearded gentleman dressed in a red suit with a black belt and white fur trim, black boots, and a soft red cap.</h4>
